    <h1 class="title">week 1 at cambridge</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">july 17th, 2024</h5>
    <p class="blog">even though i've only been here for a week and a half, it feels like i've been here for a month. so anyways, let me do a quick recap over my first week here.</p>
    <p class="blog">i checked in on saturday, july 6th. i am living on fitzwilliam street, in a nice little 19th-century house just slightly off-campus. as someone who has lived in a dorm for my freshman year at northwestern, this would be my first time living off-campus.</p>
    <p class="blog">i am taking two classes here - cyber security: the basics of ethical hacking and forensic psychology. in addition to that, i am pursuing an independent supervision project that focuses on how spotify uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) in its music recommendation system. the forensic psych and Independent supervision classes are module 3 (which means they span the whole program), while the cybersecurity class is module 2 (it only spans second half of the program). guess what a module 1 class is. (spoiler: it only runs for the first half of the program)</p>
    <p class="blog">the cybersecurity class focuses on hacking and open source intelligence gathering techniques, as well as the psychological and sociological frameworks of hacking. so it's a nice mix of stem and the humanities. because it's a module 2 class, i haven't technically taken it yet, but i will be taking it for the second half of the program. i will let y'all know how it goes.</p>
    <p class="blog">as for the forensic psych class, the first half of the class covers content about the legal system and how psychological principles play a role in it, while the second half of the class focus more on the neuroscience-y aspects of psychology and their applications in forensic contexts. it's actually taught by two professors, one for each half of the class. one thing that surprised me was the lack of a british accent that the professor had - turns out that he was American, like me.</p>
    <p class="blog">one thing i love about this program is how small and intimate these classes are, the lectures have 30 people while the seminars have 15. this really allows you to get to know your peers better. another thing i love about this program is how friendly everyone is and how they're all so eager to make friends, so i get to enjoy the social as well as academic aspect of this program. they also have group activities organized by program assistants (PAs), which i haven't been to yet (because a lot of them closed before i had an opportunity to sign up), but i just signed up for a trip to nando's.</p>
    <p class="blog">one of the highlights of my first week was going on a PA-led city tour, where i met some of my friends here. we all got gelato at the end, but i didn't. i tried to pay, but it didn't go through, so that was disappointing. my wifi wasn't great.</p>

    <p class="blog">For dinner that night, I went to Aromi, an Italian restaurant, with a friend that I had just made. We split an appetizer, which was this eggplant and olive dish (I think they call eggplants "aubergines" here), and a pizza with bell peppers and proscuitto. Because the gelato place that we had just passed by during the PA-led city tour was nearby, we decided to go again. This time, I brought cash, so I was actually able to get a gelato without any stupid Wifi/connectivity issues. I got a dark chocolate sorbet, and my friend thanked me for "motivating her for getting her second gelato of the day." Of course. Nothing beats more gelato. (Ok but can we just talk about how "thank you" isn't really in the vocabulary of our generation anymore, we all say "of course" or "I gotchu" but never "thank you" for some reason which makes me think that "thank you" is dying. But I digress.)</p>
    <p class="blog">Another highlight of the week was going to Vinyl on Friday night and jamming my heart out to throwbacks. When I was out on the dance floor with friends, I noticed a group of women dressed up as old ladies and I thought that was pretty funny. I also noticed that certain tiles on the floor would light up, kinda like stepping tiles. So that was fun. At around 1 am, we all went to Taco Bell, which only hits after midnight. As Taylor Swift puts it, it felt like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight (technically 1 am but whatever). After finishing some nacho fries, I called it a night. It was raining again, so I debated Ubering back, but decided that it wasn't worth spending more money, so I just walked back with friends.</p>
