    <h1 class="title">Week 1 at Cambridge</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">July 17th, 2024</h5>
    <p class="blog">Even though I've only been here for a week and a half, it feels like I've been here for a month. So anyways, let me do a quick recap over my first week here.</p>
    <p class="blog">I checked in on Saturday, July 6th. I am living on Fitzwilliam Street, in a nice little 19th-century house just slightly off-campus. As someone who has lived in a dorm for my freshman year at Northwestern, this would be my first time living off-campus.</p>
