      <h1 class="title">back in london baby</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">july 28th, 2024</h5>
   <p class="blog">this week was pretty boring, workload was starting to pick up, but we went to london for the weekend and i was surprised on how much we could do in one day.</p>
      <p class="blog">that morning, i woke up at 7, and was running on like 5 hours of sleep. i haven't really been sleeping well lately bc i have dissertation outlines due soon and planning trips is really stressful. i went to bed at 12 pm, which was not too late, but it took me forever to fall asleep due to the aforementioned stress. i got to the station at 7:45ish, waited for my friends to pick up their coffee orders, while i decided to sleep on the train. i changed positions at least 100 times and didn't actually fall asleep, but i tried my best. when we finally arrived at london, i got an iced americano and noticed that caffiene doesn't have as much of an impact on me anymore, which is a sign that i've been drinking too much of it.</p>
    <p class="blog">after that, we went to the borough market, which i have actually never been to. i looked around, and got a green juice.</p>

    <p class="blog">i've already been to the national gallery and the british museum, but my friends are going and it's free, so i just decided to go again. this time, i saw a lot of scenic paintings of european cities, such as venice. a lot of these paintings feature different european countries that are known for its painters, such as italy and the netherlands. i actually booked a weekend trip to amsterdam in two weeks, so i'm really excited. although italy is too far for a weekend trip during this program, i would love to visit sometime.</p>
