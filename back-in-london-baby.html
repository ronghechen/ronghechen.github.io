      <h1 class="title">back in london baby</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">july 28th, 2024</h5>
   <p class="blog">this week was pretty boring, workload was starting to pick up, but we went to london for the weekend and i was surprised on how much we could do in one day.</p>
      <p class="blog">that morning, i woke up at 7, and was running on like 5 hours of sleep. i haven't really been sleeping well lately bc i have dissertation outlines due soon and planning trips is really stressful. i went to bed at 12 pm, which was not too late, but it took me forever to fall asleep due to the aforementioned stress. i got to the station at 7:45ish, waited for my friends to pick up their coffee orders, while i decided to sleep on the train. i changed positions at least 100 times and didn't actually fall asleep, but i tried my best. when we finally arrived at london, i got an iced americano and noticed that caffiene doesn't have as much of an impact on me anymore, which is a sign that i've been drinking too much of it.</p>
    <p class="blog">after that, we went to the borough market, which i have actually never been to. i looked around, and got a green juice.</p>

    <p class="blog">i've already been to the national gallery and the british museum, but my friends are going and it's free, so i just decided to go again. this time, i saw a lot of scenic paintings of european cities, such as venice. a lot of these paintings feature different european countries that are known for its painters, such as italy and the netherlands. i actually booked a weekend trip to amsterdam in two weeks, so i'm really excited. although italy is too far for a weekend trip during this program, i would love to visit sometime.</p>

  <p class="blog">we were there for about two hours. just as we were about to leave, we went to a little cafe and picked up some pastries. that one coffee was not enough to make myself feel energized, so i got myself an iced coconut americano. i like strong coffee, with no sugar. i also like iced coffee, and on the rare occassion that i do like milk added to my coffee, it's never cow milk. always oat milk. so, i decided to try it, thinking that it would be an iced black coffee with a splash of coconut milk. but no, i was pretty surprised. i don't have a pic, but it was coconut water, with a layer of whipped coffee on top. quite a unique presentation. unfortunately, i wasn't really a fan of it, i felt like it was a little too sweet. too heavy on the coconut, too light on the coffee. but i paid for it, so i drank it. and that was when i was finally feeling energized enough to go to the british museum.</p>
  <p class="blog">even though i went to the british museum 3 weeks ago, i did not see all of it. and even now, i still did not see all the exhibits. because it's huge. but this time, i got to see even more ancient greek and roman statues, including vases, tombs, and stone tablets. i also learned quite a bit about britain's past, under the roman empire, how farming spread from the middle east to europe. i learned about the vikings and islamic civilizations, and i also got to take a look at the library within the british museum, which i didnt have an opportunity to do last time. and it's absolutely beautiful. it was considered very high-tech for its era, but very historic now. many of history's great minds studied in that library. last time, i didn't get the opportunity to get many good pics, but this time, i actually did.</p>

    <p class="blog">after spending several hours there, we got dinner. dinner was a bit of a hectic situation, since we needed to get all the way to the west end to see les mis, and they recommend getting there at least 30 minutes before the show starts. i think 30 is a bit much, more like 20. and so, we looked around the neighborhood for places to eat, but every single one of them had a huge line. we finally found an italian place, where i got a white wine and an eggplant parmagiana. originally, i wanted a pasta, but we were in a bit of a rush, and that takes longer to make, so i got a parmagiana, which was still really good! after we finished, we went to the theater, where we saw les mis. it was an otherworldly experience, since i have never been to one of these musicals before. i sat at one of the top seats in the balcony, since it was one of the cheapest seats, but the angle that i got made it feel even more majestic. the performances, the lighting, the choreography were out of this world. unfortunately, i was not allowed to take photos or videos during the performance, but here's a picture of the stage before the musical, where you can get a sense of the ambience.</p>
