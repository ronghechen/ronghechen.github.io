      <h2 class="title">background</h2>
      <p class="width">for my software studio class, my group & i created this website called notesync, a website that serves as a live music calendar where users can add and view events in their area. our team consisted of 4 full-stack developers, although we all contributed across the stack, i specialized in front-end architecture, accessibility, and geolocation-based event filtering — bridging ui/ux design with backend functionality. notesync is created in ruby on rails, and deployed using heroku.</p>

      <h2 class="title">challenges</h2>
      <p class="width">for milestone 3, which judges ux and accessibility, we noticed that we failed a lot of the accessibility checks due to the color of our background. to troubleshoot, we took a look at which specific tests we were failing on accessibilitychecker and used diffchecker to check the difference between passing and failing tests. by changing the color of the foreground text and buttons, we were able to make them "pop" more against our purple background. this helped us pass a lot of the accessibility checks.</p>

      <p class="width">another challenge we faced was "show events near me", which i worked on. while building the product, i noticed that location geocoding was very slow, and filtered results included all events, not just events near the user. to fix this, i changed the timeout limit to a longer time to allow more time for results to load, and looked for inefficiencies in code that might be causing the slowdown. i used geocoding to get the user's location, then filtered the controller to only show events within a certain radius.</p>

      <h2 class="title">takeaways</h2>
      <p class="width">as someone with more of a ux/front-end background, i intentionally challenged myself to take on backend responsibilities within this project - gaining full-stack development exposure, as well as familiarity with database systems. because i've only had experience building static websites, i've always wondered how people are able to build websites that incorporate log in/log out and track user data. notesync was a key turning point for me - it was the first time i worked on a fully dynamic, full-stack application. working on this project really allowed me to push beyond my comfort zone create more meaningful, impactful saas applications. after gaining familiarity with ruby on rails, i realized that the devise gem provided the inner workings behind authentication. i also learned about crud and the 7 restful actions, which play a role in authentication, since a session is essentially being "created" once you log in and "destroyed" once you log out.</p>
      <p class="width">in addition to my full-stack software engineering skills, working on notesync also helped me hone my ui/ux skills, teaching me how to design with empathy. i ran the words on our website through an understandability checker to check that all terminology used was understandable for the average person and also made sure that the text sizes were responsive so that people with vision impairments could zoom in and the text size would change accordingly - making our product accessible for a wider audience.</p>
      <p class="width"> i also noticed that i really like using agile methodology, since it helps break down a large, daunting project into smaller, manageable chunks. sometimes, when i struggled with theory classes, i wondered if cs was for me, but this project made me realize that i like the practical and creative side of cs. i now feel more confident navigating the full stack, and i’m excited to keep building that foundation. i want to pursue a career in ui/ux design or software engineering - one where i can bridge the gap between design and implementation.</p>
