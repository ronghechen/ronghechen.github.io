    <p class="width">for my software studio class, my group & i created this website called notesync, a website that serves as a live music calendar where users can add and view events in their area. it's created in ruby on rails, and deployed using heroku.</p>
    <h2 class="title">challenges</h2>
    <p class="width">for milestone 3, which judges ux and accessibility, we noticed that we failed a lot of the accessiblity checks due to the color of our background. to troubleshoot, we took a look at which specific tests we were failing on accessibilitychecker and used diffchecker to check the difference between passing and failing tests. by changing the color of the foreground text and buttons, we were able to make them "pop" more against our purple background. this helped us pass a lot of the accessibility checks.</p>
