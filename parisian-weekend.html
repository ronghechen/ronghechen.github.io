            <h1 class="title">parisian weekend</h1>
            <h5 class="blog">august 5th, 2024</h5>
            <p class="blog">took a weekend trip to paris. here's how it went.</p>
            <h3 class="title">saturday, august 3rd</h3>
            <p class="blog">i've been having trouble sleeping lately, so i woke up at 8:30ish, running on like 5 hours of sleep. i made my way over to cambridge station, and decided to sleep on the train. after arriving in london, i got an iced americano and boarded the eurostar.</p>
            <p class="blog">after arriving in paris, i ran into some...issues. i didn't speak french, and actually took the metro in the wrong direction as i went to my accommodation. while on the train, i realized. i got off, and went in the opposite direction. i also had some trouble checking into the airbnb at first, but i was able to do it eventually (more on that later). i realized i had booked tickets for the catacombs. which i didn't want to be late to, so i decided to get the accommodation sorted out later and meet my friend at the catacombs.</p>
            <p class="blog">while going down the spiral staircase, i noticed that as i thought the stairs were about to end, they just...wouldn't! they literally went on forever! eventually i made it down, and saw a cave full of tombs and bones. it felt a little trypophobic to me, but i learned a lot about the history of paris. i hadn't drank water for hours, so i grabbed a drink advertised as an elixir potion from the gift shop. it was a little expensive, but it was good. it was a nice fizzy drink with a sparkly color to it that gave it that "elixir" vibe, with a layer of edible glitter at the bottom.</p>

              </div>
            <p class="blog">later that evening, we went to shakespeare and co, which was a bookstore. i found some really interesting books, but was worried that i can't fit anything in my suitcase anymore, however, i did get a tote bag. after that, we had dinner at a french cafe nearby. i got a pasta, while my friend got pulled beef. after dinner, we decided to see a couple more tourist attractions in paris, such as the notre dame and the eiffel tower. the notre dame was pretty close, so we just walked there. it was still being built after the fire, even after 5 years. this was when it started raining. but we decided that we HAD to see the eiffel tower, so we took the metro there. unfortunately, we couldn't get a good view of it because of the olympics. after seeing those attractions, i headed back to my accommodation and fortunately got it all sorted out. then, i called it a night and went to bed.</p>

            <h3 class="title">sunday, august 4th</h3>
            <p class="blog">i woke up at 8:30, and checked out of my airbnb. wearing the i ❤️ paris tank that i got from the souvenir shop yesterday, i took the metro to the louvre. before my louvre visit, i got breakfast at another french cafe, where i got sunny side up eggs, bacon, a side salad, and an iced americano. after breakfast, i went into the louvre, stayed there for about two hours, and took a lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta pictures.</p>

            <p class="blog">i saw a lot of greek and roman statues, renaissance-era art, ancient pottery, inscriptions, and tablets. it was a magical experience. the ceilings really stood out to me, since they were all high, with exquisite carvings and paintings on them. a specific exhibit that really stood out to me was that room where everything was gold, and the ceiling was decorated with the months of the year, the signs of the zodiac (libra represent!) all in latin, of course.</p>
