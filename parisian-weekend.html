            <h1 class="title">parisian weekend</h1>
            <h5 class="blog">august 4th, 2024</h5>
            <p class="blog">took a weekend trip to paris. here's how it went.</p>
            <h3 class="title">saturday, august 3rd</h3>
            <p class="blog">i've been having trouble sleeping lately, so i woke up at 8:30ish, running on like 5 hours of sleep. i made my way over to cambridge station, and decided to sleep on the train. after arriving in london, i got an iced americano and boarded the eurostar.</p>
            <p class="blog">after arriving in paris, i ran into some...issues. i didn't speak french, and actually took the metro in the wrong direction as i went to my accommodation. while on the train, i realized. i got off, and went in the opposite direction. i also had some trouble checking into the airbnb at first, but i was able to do it eventually (more on that later). i realized i had booked tickets for the catacombs. which i didn't want to be late to, so i decided to get the accommodation sorted out later and meet my friend at the catacombs.</p>
            <p class="blog">while going down the spiral staircase, i noticed that as i thought the stairs were about to end, they just...wouldn't! they literally went on forever! eventually i made it down, and saw a cave full of tombs and bones. it felt a little trypophobic to me, but i learned a lot about the history of paris.</p>
            <p class="blog">later that evening, we went to shakespeare and co, which was a bookstore. i found some really interesting books, but was worried that i can't fit anything in my suitcase anymore, however, i did get a tote bag.</p>
