    <h1 class="title">4 Days in London</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">July 17th, 2024</h5>
    <p class="blog">Sorry guys, it's been a minute.</p>
    <p class="blog">Here's a long overdue blog post about the 4 days that I have spent in London.</p>
    <h3 class="title">Tuesday, July 2nd</h3>
    <p class="blog">My flight arrived at the Heathrow airport at 6:30 am. It was the first time that I had a full 8 hours of sleep on a flight, which I was proud of. As soon as I got my luggage back, I got to my hotel.</p>
    <p class="blog">It was still pretty early, so I decided to take a walk around the city. It was surprisingly cold, and I pretty much packed only summer clothes. I was still wearing the sweater and denim shorts that I slept in on the plane, except the sweater was open-knit, so it didn't do much to keep me warm. I noticed that London had a distinct European feel to it, it didn't have the high-rise skyscrapers that I was so used to seeing in Chicago. Instead, I saw a lot more historic architecture.</p>
