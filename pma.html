      <p class="width">during my internship at product manager accelerator, i worked on a project to address one of the most common and frustrating issues for SaaS products: a confusing onboarding process.</p>
      <p class="width">but the challenge wasn't just onboarding itself - it was that product teams were overwhelmed by raw feedback, struggling what to prioritize, and how to turn those insights into experiments. this reflects a broader industry problem: most customer feedback never makes it into roadmaps, and latency between feedback and action creates a “revenue leak”.</p>
      <h2 class="title">from pain points to hypotheses</h2>
      <p class="width">to solve this, i helped design a workflow that connects customer pain points directly to hypotheses and experiments.</p>
      <p class="width">here are the core improvements i worked on:</p>
      <h4 class="title">1. generate hypotheses automatically</h4>
      <p class="width">using customer quotes and ticket clusters, our system generates hypotheses for testing. this speeds up the process from weeks to hours, ensuring teams can move from “what are users frustrated about?” to “what can we test this week?”.</p>
      <h4 class="title">2. filter pain points</h4>
      <p class="width">i proposed and designed a filtering feature for the pain points dashboard, allowing product managers to sort issues by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>type: </strong> bug vs. feature request</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>urgency: </strong> high-priority issues surface faster</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>date created: </strong> identify new vs. longstanding problems</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>trend: </strong> this helps teams quickly spot whether a pain point is growing (like a broken shipping calculator) or fading</li>
      </ul>
