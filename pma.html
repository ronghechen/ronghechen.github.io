      <h2 class="title">background</h2>
      <p class="width">during my internship at product manager accelerator, i worked on a project to address one of the most common and frustrating issues for SaaS products: a confusing onboarding process.</p>
      <p class="width">but the challenge wasn't just onboarding itself - it was that product teams were overwhelmed by raw feedback, struggling what to prioritize, and how to turn those insights into experiments. this reflects a broader industry problem: most customer feedback never makes it into roadmaps, and latency between feedback and action creates a “revenue leak”.</p>
      <h2 class="title">from pain points to hypotheses</h2>
      <p class="width">to solve this, i helped design a workflow that connects customer pain points directly to hypotheses and experiments.</p>
      <p class="width">here are the core improvements i worked on:</p>
      <h4 class="title">1. generate hypotheses automatically</h4>
      <p class="width">using customer quotes and ticket clusters, our system generates hypotheses for testing. this speeds up the process from weeks to hours, ensuring teams can move from “what are users frustrated about?” to “what can we test this week?”.</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img width=40% src="details.png">
      </div>
      <h4 class="title">2. filter pain points</h4>
      <p class="width">i proposed and designed a filtering feature for the pain points dashboard, allowing product managers to sort issues by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>type: </strong> bug vs. feature request</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>urgency: </strong> high-priority issues surface faster</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>date created: </strong> identify new vs. longstanding problems</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>trend: </strong> this helps teams quickly spot whether a pain point is growing (like a broken shipping calculator) or fading</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img width=70% src="painpoints.png">
      </div>
      <h4 class="title">3. visualize ticket trends</h4>
      <p class="width">each pain point card shows ticket counts over the last 90 days, with % increase or decrease. this makes it easy to see which issues are accelerating and demand immediate action.</p>
      <h2 class="title">the design process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>inspiration: </strong> i drew on ideas from loveable.ai, an ai-powered software engineer that makes mockups.</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>collaboration: </strong> i worked closely with another designer on the pain points page and attended weekly team meetings to get feedback from our lead and peers.</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>prototyping: </strong> i built wireframes in figma and refined them into high-fidelity designs.</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>design systems & dev mode: </strong> i learned to work within a shared design system and used figma dev mode to collaborate seamlessly with developers, applying my knowledge of front-end languages to ensure smooth handoff.</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>prototyping: </strong> i built wireframes in figma and refined them into high-fidelity designs.</li>
        <li class="li_style"><strong>iterating together: </strong> through critiques, we identified UX issues and proposed fixes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="title">what i learned</h2>
      <p class="width">this project taught me how to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="li_style">translate customer frustration into testable hypotheses.</li>
        <li class="li_style">work with ai-augmented product workflows, turning raw data into actionable experiments.</li>
        <li class="li_style">use design systems and dev mode in figma to align design and development.</li>
        <li class="li_style">propose and validate new features (like filtering pain points) that improved usability.</li>
        <li class="li_style">collaborate effectively with designers, pms, and engineers to ship solutions faster.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="title">conclusion</h2>
      <p class="width">by the end of the internship, i helped build a framework where customer pain points no longer sit idle in support queues. instead, they fuel hypotheses, experiments, and product improvements — accelerating the cycle from feedback to learning.</p>
      <p class="width">this mirrors my experience of learning about design tools and practices in the industry and process of continuous learning. i will be continuing this internship at pma for cohort 6.</p>
