      <h2 class="title">background</h2>
      <p class="width">the responsible use of ai student organization (raiso) is an organization dedicated to educating students about the societal impacts of artificial intelligence, hosting programs that promote the discussion of societal and ethical implications of technology. sometimes, raiso holds events and invites ai researchers and designers to talk about their work and their views on the future of ai, and raiso also hosts workshops where students can build ai/ml projects.</p>
      <h2 class="title">challenge</h2>
        <p class="width">our current website is outdated, missing key features like a projects page, which is essential for providing students hands-on experience in ai programming. furthermore, we need to add an events page to better promote our events and increase attendance.</p>
      <h2 class="title">goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="li_style">design a projects page</li>
          <li class="li_style">design an events page</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="title">research process</h2>
      <p class="width">i was mostly in charge of redesigning the projects page, so i interviewed the projects team, asking them questions about their needs and goals. here are the following questions i have asked and the responses that i have received:</p>
      <h4 class="title">1. what is the core purpose of your committee?</h4>
      <p class="width">"the core purpose of projects is to take the skills learned in workshops through classes and spend the quarter building projects in small groups to refine the knowledge of ml/ai."</p>
      <h4 class="title">2. who do you want to engage with this section of the website? who is your audience?</h4>
      <p class="width">"people interested in ml, people who want to build projects outside of the classroom, people who care about ethics and how ml can be ethically applied."</p>
      <h4 class="title">3. what do you want the main takeaway to be? what do you want the user to do once at the page of your website?</h4>
      <p class="width">"i want users to look at the website and go 'wow they build really awesome projects' or just generally spark an interest in ml."</p>
