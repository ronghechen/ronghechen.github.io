      <h1 class="title">on reflection: failing interviews & how to improve</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">may 2nd, 2024</h5>
    <p class="blog">throughout my life, i’ve been rejected from quite a few things. although i may never know the exact reason why, i believe that a possible reason is the interview. interviews have never come naturally to me.</p>
    <p class="blog">scratch that.</p>
    <p class="blog">it was because i didn’t spend enough time preparing for them. i often found myself hesitating in the middle of an interview, just because i didn’t know the answer. although i haven’t really applied for any internships yet, a lot of clubs that I have applied to require interviews.</p>
    <p class="blog">for example, i applied for two positions on the northwestern university dance marathon (nudm) exec board - tech & analytics chair and marketing chair. to give you a little bit of background, the tech & analytics chair works on the NUDM website and app, as well as track the analytics behind the nudm demographic - who nudm is reaching, etc. the marketing chair manages NUDM’s social media presence, including instagram, facebook, and tiktok. </p>
    <p class="blog">as someone with experience in html/css and building websites, as well as graphic design and social media marketing, i thought i would be a great fit for these roles at the time. and so i worked extremely hard on my essays. i wrote them in the span of multiple days, taking breaks in between to reflect.</p>
    <p class="blog">as i was about to submit my application, i reached out to the current tech & analytics chair and marketing chair to schedule exec chats. during both of these chats, i learned a lot about what the position does (even though, in hindsight, i probably should have asked more questions and learned more).</p>
    <p class="blog">and then everything came crashing down during the actual interview. I went to Norris in the afternoon, and the interviewers asked me a series of questions. i would always find myself blanking and saying filler words such as “uhhhh…”, and this problem was exacerbated by the fact that i didn’t get enough sleep the night before. i would often find myself stumbling over my words, and saying the most random things just so i would have something to say.
</p>
    <p class="blog">that was the worst interview i’ve ever had in my life.</p>
    <p class="blog">unsurprisingly, i didn’t get either role.</p>
    <p class="blog">clubs at northwestern are already quite hard to get into, so i talked to my therapist about getting heaps and heaps of rejections. i wish there were resources that would help me get better at interviews. and then i had an idea. The women’s network at northwestern was holding an interview prep workshop, which i decided that i would go to.</p>
    <h3 class="title">so, what are my key takeaways?</h3>
    <h4 class="blog">do research on the club/company/job that you’re applying for!</h4>
    <p class="blog">this is probably the most important one, you have to know what you're talking about at all times. specifically, read into the values, projects, and culture of the organization that you're applying for and connect them back on a personal level.</p>
    <h4 class="blog">dress to impress!</h4>
    <p class="blog">even if the interviewer says "business casual", go towards the more formal end. we're talking first impressions here, and dressing nice will help you make a great first impression.</p>
    <h4 class="blog">be on time!</h4>
    <p class="blog">especially if it's a zoom/virtual interview.</p>
    <h4 class="blog">emphasize soft AND hard skills!</h4>
    <p class="blog">if you're going into tech like me, this is especially important. although these interviews largely look at your hard skills/technical abilities, emphasizing soft skills makes it clear that you know how to get along and work with others, and that you're not a robot.</p>
    <h4 class="blog">try not to repeat answers!</h4>
    <p class="blog">time is limited, so take every opportunity to showcase a different side of yourself in the interview.</p>
    <h4 class="blog">before the interview: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="li_style">start with a warm greeting!</li>
      <li class="li_style">introduce yourself → "hi, my name is ronghe chen, i’m from chicago, and i’m a current freshman at northwestern university studying computer science."</li>
      <li class="li_style">make eye contact, no interruptions, try not to fidget.</li>
      <li class="li_style">SMILE!!</li>
      <li class="li_style">wait until the interviewer stops talking to ask your own questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="blog">during the interview: </h4>
    <p class="blog">here are some common questions asked:</p>
    <h4 class="blog">"so, tell me about yourself." </h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="li_style">name, hometown, major</li>
      <li class="li_style">your intended plans/career path</li>
      <li class="li_style">what you're involved in on campus</li>
      <li class="li_style">why you think you're a good fit for the role</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="blog">"why (club/job/organization)?" </h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="li_style">find something about the organization that REALLY resonates with you.</li>
      <li class="li_style">make it personal, connect it back to yourself, your background, interests, values.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="blog">"describe your strengths and weaknesses." </h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="li_style">i always found this to be a hard one - especially with weaknesses.</li>
      <li class="li_style">be vulnerable and honest, maybe you need a bit of time to think about it, so i HIGHLY recommend prepping for this specific question in advance.</li>
      <li class="li_style">important: talk about how you will improve from your weaknesses! make a plan!</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="blog">"describe a time you demonstrated leadership/solved a problem/bounced back from failure."</h4>
    <p class="blog">think about a specific scenario under each of these situations long in advance, since these are some of the most common interview questions.</p>
    <h4 class="blog">and of course, don't forget to ask the interviewer questions as well. </h4>
    <h4 class="blog">some good questions to ask the interviewer: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="li_style">describe a typical day at (organization).</li>
      <li class="li_style">why (this organization)? what qualities in (this organization) did you see that resonated with you?</li>
      <li class="li_style">what is your favorite part of being at (organization)?</li>
      <li class="li_style">how would you describe (the organization)'s values?</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="blog">after the interview: </h4>
    <p class="blog">send the interviewer a thank you note! follow up with them, and thank them for taking the time out of their day to interview you.</p>
    <h3 class="title">conclusion</h3>
    <p class="blog">everyone faces rejection many, many times in their lifetime. you cannot control the outcome of a situation, and that includes rejections. but what you do have control of is how you react to it. learn from your rejections, learn from your mistakes, learn from your interview disasters.</p>
    <p class="blog">make a list of what questions are commonly asked, and do LOTS of research on the company/club that you're applying to. make a list of what you value in an organization, and connect it back to a personal level. think about your answers in advance. rehearse your interview to help you feel more prepared.</p>
    <p class="blog">interviews aren't easy for the vast majority of people, but know what you're looking for, why you're applying in the first place, and be yourself.</p>
    <p class="blog">you got this.</p>
