    <h1 class="title">On Reflection: Failing Interviews & How to Improve</h1>
    <p class="width">Throughout my life, I’ve been rejected from quite a few things. Although I may never know the exact reason why, I believe that a possible reason is the interview. Interviews have never come naturally to me.</p>
    <p class="width">Scratch that.</p>
    <p class="width">It was because I didn’t spend enough time preparing for them. I often found myself hesitating in the middle of an interview, just because I didn’t know the answer. Although I haven’t really applied for any internships yet, a lot of clubs that I have applied to require interviews.</p>
    <p class="width">For example, I applied for two positions on the Northwestern University Dance Marathon (NUDM) exec board - Tech & Analytics Chair and Marketing Chair. To give you a little bit of background, the Tech & Analytics chair works on the NUDM website and app, as well as track the analytics behind the NUDM demographic - who NUDM is reaching, etc. The Marketing Chair manages NUDM’s social media presence, including Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. </p>
    <p class="width">As someone with experience in HTML/CSS and building websites, as well as graphic design and social media marketing, I thought I would be a great fit for these roles at the time. And so I worked extremely hard on my essays. I wrote them in the span of multiple days, taking breaks in between to reflect.</p>
    <p class="width">As I was about to submit my application, I reached out to the current Tech & Analytics Chair and Marketing Chair to schedule exec chats. During both of these chats, I learned a lot about what the position does (even though, in hindsight, I probably should have asked more questions and learned more).</p>
