    <h1 class="title">week 2 at cambridge</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">july 22nd, 2024</h5>
   <p class="blog">still in shock that my time here is almost halfway done. like last week, i stayed in cambridge the whole time, but i explored some new museums and restaurants.</p>
  <p class="blog">this week, i had my first formal hall. at 6:45, we had a reception with drinks. i had a lot of elderflower sparkling water, which is actually quite a big thing here. in fact, i feel like sparkling water in general is more popular here than in the states. so i kept coming back for refills. the whole reception was on the lawn, which was a great opportunity to get a lot of pics with friends. i noticed that i was one of the only people who decided to wear a short dress, and worried that i wasn't dressed formally enough. i didn't know how formal this whole thing would be.</p>
  <p class="blog">after the reception, we had a nice three-course dinner with wine. it consisted of a panzanella (tomato and bread) salad, herbed lemon chicken with roasted vegetables, a strawberry cheesecake, and coffee and mints. as much as i love coffee, i decided to skip this time, because it was too late for it (at least, on a school night). however, i couldn't get enough of those mints. but the highlight of formal hall wasn't the food or the drinks. it was when a friend of mine tried the orange juice and asked if there was any alcohol in it, and the waiter laughed and said in the most stereotypical british accent ever, "dream on!"</p>
