    <h1 class="title">week 2 at cambridge</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">july 22nd, 2024</h5>
   <p class="blog">still in shock that my time here is almost halfway done. like last week, i stayed in cambridge the whole time, but i explored some new museums and restaurants.</p>
  <p class="blog">this week, i had my first formal hall. at 6:45, we had a reception with drinks. i had a lot of elderflower sparkling water, which is actually quite a big thing here. in fact, i feel like sparkling water in general is more popular here than in the states. so i kept coming back for refills. the whole reception was on the lawn, which was a great opportunity to get a lot of pics with friends. i noticed that i was one of the only people who decided to wear a short dress, and worried that i wasn't dressed formally enough. i didn't know how formal this whole thing would be.</p>
