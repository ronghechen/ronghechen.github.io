    <h1 class="title">week 2 at cambridge</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">july 22nd, 2024</h5>
   <p class="blog">still in shock that my time here is almost halfway done. like last week, i stayed in cambridge the whole time, but i explored some new museums and restaurants.</p>
  <p class="blog">this week, i had my first formal hall. at 6:45, we had a reception with drinks. i had a lot of elderflower sparkling water, which is actually quite a big thing here. in fact, i feel like sparkling water in general is more popular here than in the states. so i kept coming back for refills. the whole reception was on the lawn, which was a great opportunity to get a lot of pics with friends. i noticed that i was one of the only people who decided to wear a short dress, and worried that i wasn't dressed formally enough. i didn't know how formal this whole thing would be.</p>

  </div>
  <p class="blog">after the reception, we had a nice three-course dinner with wine. it consisted of a panzanella (tomato and bread) salad, herbed lemon chicken with roasted vegetables, a strawberry cheesecake, and coffee and mints. as much as i love coffee, i decided to skip this time, because it was too late for it (at least, on a school night). however, i couldn't get enough of those mints. but the highlight of formal hall wasn't the food or the drinks. it was when a friend of mine tried the orange juice and asked if there was any alcohol in it, and the waiter laughed and said in the most stereotypical british accent ever, "dream on!"</p>
  <p class="blog">this week, i had my second independent supervision, where i discussed with my supervisor where i want to take my project. i decided that building a music recommendation algorithm using machine learning would be too big of an undertaking for a six-week program, so i decided to write a review on how convolutional neural networks analyze sound files and try to group together similar ones, and how effective these algorithms are. while writing my outline, i focused not only on the architecture of the convolutional neural network, but also the psychological/philosophical aspects of music recommendation algorithms. some critics say that trying to quantify features of music is not effective, as it takes away from the nuance and artistic nature of music. i thought that was a pretty interesting perspective. another article i read stated that different users had different preferences, and that allowing the users some degree of control over music preferences in an algorithm made for more effective recommendations overall. it also allowed for the users to discover new tracks that may have previously been neglected by the system, which comes to show that although we are currently living in an age of advanced technology, these algorithms are not perfect. overall, the goal of these algorithms is to ensure user satisfaction in the long run, and that's an important step to work towards.</p>
  <p class="blog">another highlight of the week was attending a lecture, which focused on the lessons learned from a lifetime in politics. after listening to that lecture, i decided that i could never go into politics. i also got a list of topics for my module 3 (forensic psych) dissertation, and, while i haven't decided on a topic yet, the one that pertains to ethical issues regarding the law and mental illness really stood out to me. another topic i was interested in was the one about how psychological principles are applied in legal settings.</p>
  <p class="blog">on wednesday, it finally got above 70Â°. thank god. summer has officially begun in cambridge. but it got really hot on friday. i packed almost all short sleeves, tank tops, and shorts - and now i actually get to wear them. on friday, we went out to vinyl (again) and later on mash. this was actually my first time going to mash, and i decided that i liked the vibe there more. i am, after all, more of an edm girlie than a retro girlie. however, the pearl necklace that i bought at the cambridge marketplace came off at the club and i was so sad.</p>

   <p class="blog">on saturday, i didn't do much. the dining hall was closed for a wedding, so i got to try food from around cambridge, so that was fun. however, on sunday, i visited the fitzwilliam museum with a friend. i've always wanted to go, since i love visiting museums and learning about different cultures. it's also conveniently located, being just a minute away from where i live on campus. once i stepped inside, i saw some of the most beautiful architecture that i had ever seen in my entire life. it reminded me of the british museum. first, we headed to the second floor to look at some paintings. a lot of the paintings focused on social issues at the time, many of which had to do with the role of women in society. a painting that stood out to me was of a woman reading in nature, which represented how women (at the time) were expected to be connected to nature, and men were more associated with human culture, politics, and society. it seems very interesting because, although (unfortunately) gender stereotyping still occurs over certain occupations, the stereotypes have changed over the years. As I walked through the gallery, I saw paintings from many different perspectives. Many art museums focus on European paintings, since a lot of famous painters are from European countries. However, I had the opportunity to see paintings from around the world, and it felt great to see my culture represented in these museums.</p>
  <p class="blog">in addition to that, we saw some sculptures out in the main hall, which come to show how different the standards of beauty were back then vs. today. as soon as we explored the entire second floor, we made our way down to the first floor, which had a lot of pottery and ancient relics. while exploring these exhibits, i got to see pottery from many different parts of the world, from western europe to the middle east to east asia. we also saw statues and tombs from ancient greece and rome, as well as armor from medieval europe. the museum closed sooner than we thought, so as soon as we got the 10-min warning, we decided to speedrun the rest of the exhibits. i definitely underestimated how big this museum was, just an hour and a half was not enough to explore the entire museum. we needed an entire afternoon. so yeah, we will definitely be coming back.</p>
