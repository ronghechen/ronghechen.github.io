    <h1 class="title">3 Days in London</h1>
    <h5 class="blog">July 17th, 2024</h5>
    <p class="blog">Sorry guys, it's been a minute.</p>
    <p class="blog">Here's a long overdue blog post about the 3 days that I have spent in London.</p>
    <h3 class="title">Tuesday, July 2nd</h3>
    <p class="blog">My flight arrived at the Heathrow airport at 6:30 am. It was the first time that I had a full 8 hours of sleep on a flight, which I was proud of. As soon as I got my luggage back, I got to my hotel.</p>
    <p class="blog">It was still pretty early, so I decided to take a walk around the city. It was surprisingly cold, and I pretty much packed only summer clothes. I was still wearing the sweater and denim shorts that I slept in on the plane, except the sweater was open-knit, so it didn't do much to keep me warm. I noticed that London had a distinct European feel to it, it didn't have the high-rise skyscrapers that I was so used to seeing in Chicago. Instead, I saw a lot more historic architecture. Later, I stopped at a cafe, picking up an oat milk cappuccino.</p>

    <p class="blog">Later that day, I got tickets for the Tower of London. That was when it started raining. I noticed that British rain is lighter, but more frequent, than American rain (at least where I come from, in Chicago). Being a major tourist attraction, the line was quite long - but moved surprisingly fast. I noticed that, where there used to be a moat, there was now a field of flowers. As I walked in, I learned that this place used to be a prison that held famous, well-known criminals. It felt very authentic and medieval, with narrow, spiraling stairs and glass mosaics.</p>
    <p class="blog">I spent the afternoon at Tate Modern, a modern art museum that was just a few minutes away from my hotel. While walking through the exhibits, I noticed that a lot of these works served as commentary on our society. </p>
    <h3 class="title">Wednesday, July 3rd</h3>
    <p class="blog">Still jet lagged, I woke up quite early. Trying to overcome the tiredness, I grabbed coffee. It was still barely 8, and the British Museum opened at 10. So I decided to walk around the Big Ben, and of course take some pictures. My fatal flaw is that I will take pictures of literally anything. And yeah, it was scenic. After all, it is the Big Ben, which is another famous tourist attraction.</p>
