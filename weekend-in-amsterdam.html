      <h1 class="title">weekend in amsterdam</h1>
      <h5 class="blog">august 12th, 2024</h5>
      <p class="blog">last weekend in europe, spent it in amsterdam (and brussels)!</p>
      <h3 class="title">friday, august 9th</h3>
      <p class="blog">after my last class that day, i took the eurostar to amsterdam. i finally arrived at 11:30ish pm, and checked into my airbnb. however, i found out that my powerbank died (like DIED DIED, and there was no way to recharge it), my phone was on 12% battery, and i only had an "american" charger. i was freaking out at this point bc i had my eurostar tickets back to london on my phone, not to mention my london to cambridge train tickets. so if my phone actually died, there was no way for me to get home. and so i slept, or at least attempted to. my airbnb was in a very touristy area, near a lot of bars and pubs. between the stress i faced with my charger situation and those dudes yelling over soccer at 3 am, it was hard for me to get any sleep.</p>
      <h3 class="title">saturday, august 10th</h3>
      <p class="blog">i "woke up" at 8 (notice how woke up is in quotes bc i didn't get any actual sleep), and planned on getting coffee, breakfast, and a european charger. i saw these locals who owned a cafe setting up, and i asked them where i could get a european-style charger. the lady was so nice and said she would charge my phone for me, and recommended a place where i could get a charger, and told me to get some more rest. and so i did. (by the way, on the very slim chance that you're reading this, i cannot thank you enough!!!) i slept for a couple more hours, picked up my newly charged phone, thanked her, and got myself a new charger and power bank.</p>
      <p class="blog">after that, i got breakfast, and went to the rijksmuseum. i saw paintings from the netherlands (and other european countries), pottery (since the netherlands is also known for its porcelain), and other historical artifacts like ship models and historical clothing. i also admired the architecture inside the rijksmuseum, the stained glass windows, and the library within. it was absolutely beautiful, but i wished they would show a little more art from different cultures instead of mostly european art.</p>
      <p class="blog">i also had the opportunity to walk around amsterdam and take pictures in front of canals. i'm pretty tall for an american girl, but coming to amsterdam was one of the rare instances where i felt short. dutch people are known for being really tall, and it definitely wasn't uncommon to see women over 6 feet.</p>
      <p class="blog">i saw another museum, the moco museum. this one was a bit more of a modern art museum, and there were many interactive exhibits, such as a mirror exhibit, and some video exhibits.</p>
      <p class="blog">at this point, i was so tired that i went back to my airbnb and took a nap. after i woke up at around dinner time, i got some noodles, walked around the streets of amsterdam, did some cheese sampling, and went out to a couple of bars and clubs that night. i finally got home around 3 am, and noticed that i was out of data. but i was too tired to care, so i just went to bed.</p>
      <h3 class="title">sunday, august 11th</h3>
      <p class="blog">i woke up, got coffee and breakfast, checked out of my airbnb, and went to the heineken experience. i got a tour around the heineken brewery, and got to taste some heineken beers. after that, i got to go to the rooftop and got a nice view of the city.</p>
      <p class="blog">after that, i was about to go to the train station, then went on one last walk around the city. when i finally got on the train, i took the train from amsterdam to brussels, then brussels to london. between these two trains, i had a couple hours, so i walked around brussels, admired its architecture, but didn't have enough time to do any actual touristy stuff (though i wish i did)!</p>
