      <h1 class="title">weekend in amsterdam</h1>
      <h5 class="blog">august 12th, 2024</h5>
      <p class="blog">last weekend in europe, spent it in amsterdam (and brussels)!</p>
      <h3 class="title">friday, august 9th</h3>
      <p class="blog">after my last class that day, i took the eurostar to amsterdam. i finally arrived at 11:30ish pm, and checked into my airbnb. however, i found out that my powerbank died (like DIED DIED, and there was no way to recharge it), my phone was on 12% battery, and i only had an "american" charger. i was freaking out at this point bc i had my eurostar tickets back to london on my phone, not to mention my london to cambridge train tickets. so if my phone actually died, there was no way for me to get home. and so i slept, or at least attempted to. my airbnb was in a very touristy area, near a lot of bars and pubs. between the stress i faced with my charger situation and those dudes yelling over soccer at 3 am, it was hard for me to get any sleep.</p>
