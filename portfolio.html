        <p class="width">the responsible use of ai student organization at northwestern (raiso) is an organization dedicated to educating students about the societal impacts of artificial intelligence, hosting programs that promote the discussion of societal and ethical implications of technology. sometimes, raiso holds events and invites ai researchers and designers to talk about their work and their views on the future of ai, and raiso also hosts workshops where students can build ai/ml projects.</p>
        <p class="width">as a member of the raiso website team, i am in charge of revamping the raiso website. i believe that a well-designed website with an intuitive interface is key to creating an impactful user experience, thus helping raiso gain more traction and some potential new members :) some of my responsibilities include conducting user interviews and asking potential users what features they are most likely to click on while first visiting the website, which guides us in our decision-making process. the current website can be found 
          <a class="link" href="https://www.raiso.org">here</a>
