      <h3 class="title">web dev → product management</h3>
        <p class="width">the responsible use of ai student organization at northwestern (raiso) is an organization dedicated to educating students about the societal impacts of artificial intelligence, hosting programs that promote the discussion of societal and ethical implications of technology. sometimes, raiso holds events and invites ai researchers and designers to talk about their work and their views on the future of ai, and raiso also hosts workshops where students can build ai/ml projects.</p>
        <p class="width">when i was a web developer on the raiso website team, i was in charge of revamping the raiso website during winter/spring 2024. the current website can be found 
          <a class="link" href="https://www.raiso.org">here</a>
        </p>
      <p class="width">in sept 2024, i became one of the website co-chairs for raiso.</p>
      <p class="width">update jan 2025: under my time as website co-chair, we have successfully created an about page, as well as an events page. however, we decided not to get too detailed with the website revamp, as we are currently planning for a migration to react this winter/spring (which is where our projects page will be implemented). during fall 2024, we decided to make a couple of changes to our current website that will make it look more presentable and aid in securing partnerships and furthering business goals, but we plan on making the next iteration of our website even more detailed and fleshed-out. i'm highly excited for my new role at raiso, teaching members of the website committee how to program in react and i'm also really excited to release our new, migrated website :)</p>
